00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.900
So here, the add event listener function

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:04.800
is the higher order function.

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:06.000
And why?

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Well, because it receives another function as an input.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.500
In this case, the greet function.

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.200
And we usually say that the function that is passed in is a callback function.
